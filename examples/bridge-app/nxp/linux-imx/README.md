# NXP Linux Matter-Zigbee Bridge Example Application

The example demonstrating a simple Matter-Zigbee bridge and the use of dynamic endpoints. Zigbee devices can
join the Matter network through the Matter-Zigbee Bridge. The Bridge can through Ethernet or wifi to join in
Matter Network.

Support Zigbee devices type:
- Lighting
- Temperature Sensor

The document will describe the theory of operation and how to build
and run CHIP Linux Matter-Zigbee Bridge Example on NXP i.MX93, NXP k32W061 as Zigbee DCP connect to i.MX93.

About how to use the wifi or join in Homekit ecosystem can refer to the doc.

### Dynamic Endpoints

The Bridge Example makes use of Dynamic Endpoints. Current SDK support is
limited for dynamic endpoints, since endpoints are typically defined (along with
the clusters and attributes they contain) in a .zap file which then generates
code and static structures to define the endpoints.

To support endpoints that are not statically defined, the ZCL attribute storage
mechanisms will hold additional endpoint information for `NUM_DYNAMIC_ENDPOINTS`
additional endpoints. These additional endpoint structures must be defined by
the application and can change at runtime.

To facilitate the creation of these endpoint structures, several macros are
defined:

`DECLARE_DYNAMIC_ATTRIBUTE_LIST_BEGIN(attrListName)`
`DECLARE_DYNAMIC_ATTRIBUTE(attId, attType, attSizeBytes, attrMask)`
`DECLARE_DYNAMIC_ATTRIBUTE_LIST_END(clusterRevision)`

-   These three macros are used to declare a list of attributes for use within a
    cluster. The declaration must begin with the
    `DECLARE_DYNAMIC_ATTRIBUTE_LIST_BEGIN` macro which will define the name of
    the allocated attribute structure. Each attribute is then added by the
    `DECLARE_DYNAMIC_ATTRIBUTE` macro. Finally,
    `DECLARE_DYNAMIC_ATTRIBUTE_LIST_END` macro should be used to close the
    definition.

-   All attributes defined with these macros will be configured as
    `ATTRIBUTE_MASK_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` in the ZCL database and therefore will
    rely on the application to maintain storage for the attribute. Consequently,
    reads or writes to these attributes must be handled within the application
    by the `emberAfExternalAttributeWriteCallback` and
    `emberAfExternalAttributeReadCallback` functions. See the bridge
    application's `main.cpp` for an example of this implementation.

`DECLARE_DYNAMIC_CLUSTER_LIST_BEGIN(clusterListName)`
`DECLARE_DYNAMIC_CLUSTER(clusterId, clusterAttrs, incomingCommands, outgoingCommands)`
`DECLARE_DYNAMIC_CLUSTER_LIST_END`

-   These three macros are used to declare a list of clusters for use within a
    endpoint. The declaration must begin with the
    `DECLARE_DYNAMIC_CLUSTER_LIST_BEGIN` macro which will define the name of the
    allocated cluster structure. Each cluster is then added by the
    `DECLARE_DYNAMIC_CLUSTER` macro referencing attribute list previously
    defined by the `DECLARE_DYNAMIC_ATTRIBUTE...` macros and the lists of
    incoming/outgoing commands terminated by kInvalidCommandId (or nullptr if
    there aren't any commands in the list). Finally,
    `DECLARE_DYNAMIC_CLUSTER_LIST_END` macro should be used to close the
    definition.

`DECLARE_DYNAMIC_ENDPOINT(endpointName, clusterList)`

-   This macro is used to declare an endpoint and its associated cluster list,
    which must be previously defined by the `DECLARE_DYNAMIC_CLUSTER...` macros.

## Building

-   Prepare Build Enviroment on Host PC

    - Install Yocto SDK. Refer to the ReadME to generate SDK.[How to build OpenThread Border Router with the Yocto SDK](https://github.com/nxp-imx/meta-matter/blob/imx_matter_2023_q2/README.md)

        ```
        # Generate yocto sdk
        $ bitbake imx-image-multimedia -c populate_sdk

        # install sdk for i.MX93
        $ sudo tmp/deploy/sdk/fsl-imx-xwayland-glibc-x86_64-imx-image-multimedia-armv8a-imx93evk-toolchain-6.1-langdale.sh
        ```

    -   Build the example application:

        ```
        user@ubuntu:~/Desktop/git/connectedhomeip$ export export IMX_SDK_ROOT=/opt/fsl-imx-xwayland/6.1-langdale-imx93
        user@ubuntu:~/Desktop/git/connectedhomeip$ source scripts/activate.sh
        user@ubuntu:~/Desktop/git/connectedhomeip$ ./scripts/examples/imxlinux_example.sh examples/bridge-app/nxp/linux-imx  out/imx-bridge-app
        ```
Then the imx-chip-bridge-app was generated under out/imx-bridge-app
